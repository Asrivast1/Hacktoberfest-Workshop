## Making PR ###

1. Fork the repository to your own account

2. Cloning repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git

3. cd repository

4. Create Branch

 git branch new-branch

5. Now that our new branch is created, we can switch to make sure that we are working on that branch by using the git checkout command:

git checkout branch

 or instead of above two steps we can write

git checkout -b new-branch



If you want to switch back to master, you’ll use the checkout command with the name of the master branch
 
git checkout master


6. Once you have modified existing files or added new files to the project, 
you can add them to your local repository, which we can do with the git add command. 
Let’s add the -A flag to add all changes that we have made:

git add -A

7. Commiting (Now see is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is
	Additionally you can add messages)

git commit -m "message"


8. Once you have saved and exited the commit message text file, you can verify what git will be committing with the following command:

git status


9. Push 

git push origin new-branch

 or if you encounter any problem try

git push -f
